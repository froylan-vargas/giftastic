## Description
Web app that let's you pick a category and look for gifs from giphy api, 
then you can add wanted gifs to fav section, copy the gif or store it 
to your device.

### Technical approach.
I've created one UI gif component, and then I draw all the gifs in the UI dynamically using jQuery. This allows to have a cleaner html and more readable code. 

### Improvements Version 1.1 Added 2018-09-26
- [x] Cannot duplicate the same gif in favs. 
- [x] The content is never wider than your screen. 
- [x] Secret theme when clicking FVG
- [x] Forgot what you search for? Search for title added
- [x] Filters drop down updates the screen immediately
- [x] FVG is now centered
- [x] First things first: Filters on left, buttons on right
- [x] What de you need is more kind than what do you want?
- [x] Fixed gif sizes to be fully screen responsive
